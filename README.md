## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The automotive industry is undergoing one of the most significant transformation periods in its history. New propulsion systems, regulations, consumer demands, and other factors are challenging the status quo of this century-old industry.

For this reason, and thanks to the Open Data portal of the ([DGT (Dirección General de Tráfico) en cifras](https://www.dgt.es/menusecundario/dgt-en-cifras/)), I became interested in gaining a deeper understanding of some key figures relevant for the electrification of Spain by looking at the vehicles being registered in the last 12 months in Spain, focusing on the following questions for toursim vehicles:

1. Are the spanish costumers purchasing electrified vehicles?
2. Which spanish provinces have the biggest and smallest number of electrified vehicles registrations?
3. Which spanish provinces are registering more and less polluting vehicles?
4. Which car brands are selling more and less ecological cars in Spain?
   
## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The data used for this project is the [Microdatos de Matriculaciones de Vehículos (mensual)](https://www.dgt.es/menusecundario/dgt-en-cifras/dgt-en-cifras-resultados/dgt-en-cifras-detalle/Microdatos-de-parque-de-vehiculos-anual/) by the Spanish General Traffic Administration ([DGT - Dirección General de Tráfico)](https://www.dgt.es/)).

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here]().

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

I would like to acknowledge the Spanish General Traffic Administration ([DGT- Dirección General de Tráfico)](https://www.dgt.es/) for publishing so much data in an open way and to allow everyone to explore and study it. It is really an example of how a public entity should manage the access to its data. Also I would like to acknowledge [Hijmans, Robert J.](https://earthworks.stanford.edu/?f%5Bdct_creator_sm%5D%5B%5D=Hijmans%2C+Robert+J.) for the [polygon shapefile of spanish provinces](https://earthworks.stanford.edu/catalog/stanford-np165yq7060) that I used for the project.
